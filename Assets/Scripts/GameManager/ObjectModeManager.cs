//Simple script that defines the state of an object based on the camera state (2d or 3d)
//This is used to change behaviours, sprites, models, etc...
//Each object in the scene could have one of this if any of their components change
//based on the camera mode

//This script is for more general purposes, if you want to make specific changes on
//a gameobject you should create a script that inherits from this one.
